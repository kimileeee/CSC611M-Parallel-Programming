"iCon conversations are interactive events where University Fellows converge to converse and connect with members of the academic community and the Lasallian family. An iCon conversation begins with a short, light-and-easy talk, followed by an enriching discussion, over coffee, between the iCon speaker(s) and the members of the audience, who are expected to come from various disciplines. To keep the discussion manageable, the audience will be capped at 30 participants. Pre-register by emailing the SUF assistant, Ms. Alma Sabulao, at",alma.sabulao@dlsu.edu.ph
